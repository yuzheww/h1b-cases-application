# h1b-cases-application

### We plan to design an application that allows users to search and modify H-1B application information. We intend to establish a database-supported web application that has access to all the H1B visa applications from 2015-2019 in a Kaggle dataset. Our primary motivation is that foreign workers are becoming a crucial component of the American Labor force. The H-1B visa is the prerequisite for workers who are foreign nationals and want to work in the United States, but the process of application may not be transparent to all applicants. Therefore, we wish to contribute to the labor force market by offering them H-1B a well-regulated and designed platform to attain various information about H-1B visa applications. The project involves a full-stack development that supports the system.
